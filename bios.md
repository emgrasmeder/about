## A collection of short biographies from when they've been required of me
###### (I'm amused to see how my description of self changes over time)


### Write Speak Code 2016: Soft Skills are Hard
Emma's official job title is "Data Witch," but there's more to them than spellcraft and data science. They lead workshops on team dynamics and sexual assault prevention, evangelize Test Driven Development and speaking at meetups, make music and soups, and take really excellent selfies. Ask them to meet you for coffee, and they'll make time for you. 

### Lesbians Who Tech NYC, 2016
Emma Grasmeder is the director of the Lesians Who Tech Berlin chapter, the Mapbox data witch, and jade of all trades. 
Emma is an archetypal Gemini with a passion for petting puppies, taking long walks in the rain, and questioning the status quo.

### Code Newbies, 2016
Emma Grasmeder is the former Director of Education for Women Who Code: DC, the resident data witch at Mapbox, and the to-be Director of Lesbians Who Tech: Berlin. Before any of that they were a grad school flunkie, an au pair, and a near college drop out before they graduated with a degree in religious studies. Emma spends free time strumming a banjo, reading about Judaism, and considering the day when robots revolt against their programmers.

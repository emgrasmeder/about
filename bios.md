## A collection of short biographies from when they've been required of me
###### (I'm amused to see how my description of self changes over time)


### Write Speak Code, NYC 2016: Soft Skills are Hard
Emma's official job title is "Data Witch," but there's more to them than spellcraft and data science. They lead workshops on team dynamics and sexual assault prevention, evangelize Test Driven Development and speaking at meetups, make music and soups, and take really excellent selfies. Ask them to meet you for coffee, and they'll make time for you. 


### Lesbians Who Tech,  NYC 2016
Emma Grasmeder is the director of the Lesians Who Tech Berlin and the data witch at Mapbox. In the last five years, they have been an au-pair in Austria, spent three years failing out of an economics PhD program, and became the chief data scientist of a tech start up. Usually thinking about robots, plants, witchcraft, Appalachian folk music, or dismantling systems of oppression, Emma is an archetypal Gemini who enjoys long bike rides in the rain and has a proclivity for petting puppies. Emma uses they/them pronouns. 

### Code Newbies, Washington, DC 2016
Emma Grasmeder is the former Director of Education for Women Who Code: DC, the resident data witch at Mapbox, and the to-be Director of Lesbians Who Tech: Berlin. Before any of that they were a grad school flunkie, an au pair, and a near college drop out before they graduated with a degree in religious studies. Emma spends free time strumming a banjo, reading about Judaism, and considering the day when robots revolt against their programmers. 

### OOP, 2017
Emma Grasmeder is the Data Witch of ThoughtWorks Germany, where she enjoys automating infrastructure, advocating for better security practices, writing well tested software, and nurturing growing data scientists and software developers. Formerly an experimental economist, she taught herself to code in graduate school and now spends much of her time thinking about agent based models, genetic programming, the universal basic income, and teaching a broad spectrum of software topics.

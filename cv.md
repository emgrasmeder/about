I'm a functional programming enthusiast with a background in data science, currently advising clients on how to do Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning and Scientific Computing use cases. I'm comfortable in the role of technical lead and am drawn towards conversations around business goals and product vision, but happiest writing code all day. I believe that almost all the times when a tech endeavor fails, it's not because the technology was too complicated but because _people are complicated_. I think it's vital to focus on the humans - from the customers to the development team to management structures. 

Whether in a position of leadership or not, I try to approach problems the same way: as an anarchist. I believe in the power of consensus, accountability, taking personal responsibility, and asking, "what are the systemic problems?" and "how can we make this better for everyone?"

## Relevant Experience
### Technical Lead/Tech Principal, Chemical Production Company (November 2020-Present)
Overview: The client hired us to develop a workflow which enabled their data scientists to track and version their data, code, and models in a comprehensive way.

Core Responsibilities:
- Introduce and cultivate an agile mindset for a diverse team of infrastructure engineers, data scientists, and fullstack developers
- Contribue code to (TypeScript) front end
- Develop data visualizations for data models
- Improving infrastructure through Helm Charts or Azure Pipeline definitions
- Define, prioritize, and plan work for the team
- Develop automatic pipeline for training, versioning, and deploying data science models from any number of data scientists at the company

Interesting Challenges:
- Developing a technical vision within a large company that's ready to invest in modernization
- Bridging the communication gap between research scientists and infrastructure engineers
- Architecting a solution for versioning data science models, versioning multiple data sources, and making insights of the models accessible and data readily available
###### Core technologies involved: Python, Javascript + TypeScript, Azure


### Technical Lead, Retail - Logistics (August 2020 - October 2020)
Overview: The goal of this project was to convert a complicated and outdated system of emails and Excel tables into an automated, tested, validated data pipeline in 3 months, with a team of 4.

Core Responsibilities: 
- Identify critical workflows to automate, understand business context, and produce sustainable but minimal working product
- Onboard 3 team members to exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data transformations with an eye on testing and performance 
- Consulting stakeholders on future planning, coming up with different roadmaps depending on what funding becomes available 
Interesting Challenges:
- Having 3 months from inception to product delivery handover of a production system
- Applying functional programming paradigms to data processing workflow

###### Core technologies involved: Python, pandas

### Technical Lead, Railway Industry (May 2019 - March 2020)
Overview: The client hired us to design a product, prototype it, and find a market for the product in an experiment to find new business models for the company.

Core Responsibilities:
- Develop a cloud solution suitable for analyzing millions of records of data from moving trains all around the world
- Design railway-certifiable hardware (i.e. the "black box" for a train) which uploads train sensor data under conditions of uncertain internet connectivity. (Where losing or leaking a single data point could likely result in legal consequenes)
- Collaborated with C-Suite in product and customer strategy. The product my team designed is currently running in trains for several customers
- Train the team of 5, most of whom had never written code professionally, into a team full of effective, confident, and capable developers.
Interesting Challenges:
- Stakeholder management of an hundred year old hardware company, working regularly with sales, hardware development teams, and the CEO and CTO. 
- Designing a product while prototyping, gathering customer feedback, and generally bringing a product to market

###### Core technologies involved: Clojure, Javascript, React, AWS, PostgreSQL

### Developer, Automotive (April 2017 - April 2019)
- Fullstack developer on several teams for the same automotive client, working to build a new Point of Sales system for retailers in Germany. 
- Core contributor for several micro-frontend and micro-backend services.
- Heavy emphasis on core functionalities as well as development of contract tests, integration tests, functional tests, and maintenance of the CI/CD pipelines and the 3 deployment environments. 
- Served as security champion for the account for 2 years, inlcuding overseeing a transition to GDPR compliance as the new laws came out.
###### Core technologies involved: Clojure, Javascript, React + Redux, Openshift, PostgreSQL

### Tech Stuff I'm Proficient in
- Clojure
- Python (Data Science and backend web dev stuff) 
- JavaScript (React, Redux, Node, also some data science)
- Bash (I actually really like Bash for some reason)
- AWS, Azure

I've also done Golang, Kotlin, and Scala at work but less of it

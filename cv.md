I'm a functional programming enthusiast with a background in data science. I'm currently advising clients on how to do Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning and Scientific Computing use cases. 
#### Tech Stuff I'm Proficient in
- Clojure
- Python (Data Science and backend web dev stuff) 
- JavaScript (React, Redux, Node, also some data science)
- Bash (I actually really like Bash for some reason)
- AWS, Azure

I've also done Golang, Kotlin, and Scala at work but less of it

I'm a functional programming enthusiast with a background in data science. I'm currently advising clients on how to do Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning and Scientific Computing use cases. I'm comfortable in the role of technical lead and am drawn towards conversations around business goals and product vision. I believe that almost all the times when a tech endeavor fails, it's not because the technology was too complicated but because _people are complicated_. I think it's vital to focus on the humans - from the customers to the development team, on through the management structure. 


Em was the tech lead for a cross-functional team of developers who came together with the goal of creating a cloud solution suitable for analyzing millions of records of data from moving trains all around the world. Emphasizing the principles of consensus, collaboration, and personal autonomy, Em's leadership helped turn a group of people, most of whom had never written code professionally, into a team full of effective, confident, and capable developers. In addition to pushing the team to develop quickly and comprehensively, Em was in frequent contact with members in the client C-suite to make recommendations regarding business direction and forging new communication patterns within the organization.
Core technologies involved: Clojure, Javascript, React, AWS, MySQL
Developer, Automotive 

Em worked as part of a ThoughtWorks team to build a new Point of Sales system for retailers in Germany. This involved integrating with various backend systems, and integrating the work of multiple project teams into a seamless web application while maintaining team independence. Em worked as a Full Stack developer on a distributed team with a micro-frontend architecture. Em's focus outside of standard delivery was on GDPR compliance and the general cybersecurity landscape of the product. 
Core technologies involved: Clojure, Javascript, React + Redux, Openshift, MySQL
Data Scientist, ThoughtWorks Data Tech Lab 

The objective of the project was to get a better understanding of the differences between software development and data science projects regarding ThoughtWorks' core practices. The task was to forecast demand for two weeks for about 4,000 items in 50 stores of an Ecuadorian grocery chain, using 4.5 years of historical data. We applied the following machine learning models and evaluated them:
 Moving averages as our baseline model, Tree-based models (random forest), Time Series Forecasting with "Prophet", Gradient Boosting Machines, Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM Network), Ensemble Approach of different models. 
In the project, we published a tutorial on Github which enables developers to kick start the data science and data engineering work on a project. This work has been used as the basis for internal recruitment, and external hackathon and trainings. 
Core technologies involved: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Keras (based on Tensorflow), Spark, AWS


#### Tech Stuff I'm Proficient in
- Clojure
- Python (Data Science and backend web dev stuff) 
- JavaScript (React, Redux, Node, also some data science)
- Bash (I actually really like Bash for some reason)
- AWS, Azure

I've also done Golang, Kotlin, and Scala at work but less of it

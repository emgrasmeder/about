#### Relevant Experience

##### Mapbox, Data Witch (March 2016 - November 2016)
- Measured street traffic patterns based on millions of miles of telemetry data (in GeoJSON format)
- Maintained road intersection analysis suite, a custom map-reduce algorithm to accumulate and analyze behavior of cars maneuvering through intersections
- Created statistics libraries to measure confidence for samples of data
  - https://github.com/mapbox/sample-sizer
  - https://github.com/mapbox/stats-online
- Made feature-engineering decisions for the company's `modality` filter, a neural net designed to identify GeoJSON linestrings from _walking_, _driving_, or _biking_ traffic.
- Managed Amazon EC2 cluster to run analysis on the planet's road network, triggered by a Cron job and a AWS Lambda

##### Solebrity, Inc, Chief Data Scientist (Jan 2015 – Jan 2016)

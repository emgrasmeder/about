#### Talks and Abstracts:
##### Soft Skills are Hard
This talk grew out of the frustration and stigma I felt as I prepared to give a different talk; one which also had a "non-technical" focus. _"I think my topic is really important but I also think as a techy femme person, I need to be seen giving more technical talks,"_ I said to myself. But wait a minute! In the tech industry today, skills and conference talks are overlooked and undervalued when they focus on things like interpersonal communication, justice in hiring, ethics in general, emotional sustainability in the workplace, and anything else firmly outside the realm of either hardware or software techniques. The bias favoring "hard skills" and "technical" talks holds "non-technical" skills as somehow less important and less difficult, even as so much team/company dysfunction is the result of deficiency in non-technical realms. This talk explores this tech/non-tech dichotomy, why it's faulty, and why the audience's social engineering skills are as important as their software engineering skills, if not moreso. My goal is to inspire people such that they're ready to demand respect for their social proficiencies in their office, at conferences, and in their lives.

##### Sick Days: Working with Mental Health Issues (An Onlooker's Guide) 
"Good morning, Emma! How are you today?" Well to be honest, Matt, I'm having one of those days where I wish I were dead and I'm trying not to think about it. Hows your morning been?

Mental health issues are tough. They're tough for those of us who experience them, and they're tough for our friends and colleagues who want to help. Nothing in this talk is going to change those facts. Mental illness is always going to suck. Nonetheless, we need to talk about it. It doesn't have to suck as much as it does. My goal for this talk is to provide a point of reference, a vocabulary, insight, context, and concrete takeaways for people who want to support their colleagues struggling with mental and emotional health. The ideas in this talk come primarily from other software developers with mental health challenges, my own experiences, and talking to colleagues who have supported me during and after I came out with an eating problem and problems with self harm.

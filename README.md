# You've found Em Grasmeder's "about me" page

Here, you can find [Resume/CV](https://github.com/emmagras/about/blob/master/cv.md) You can also [raise an issue on this repository](https://github.com/emmagras/about/issues) to ask me any questions about myself. ❤️

I think my struggles and regrettable descisions have helped forge me into a stronger, more emotionally intelligent human. I have a habit of learning things the hard way and so I [travel to conferences](https://github.com/emmagras/about/blob/master/speaking-engagements.md) to talk about these lessons in addition to the technical talks I give. I try to talk openly about being trans, mental health issues, life as an immigrant in Germany, and the struggles of executive dysfunction and ADHD. You can reach me at em@gras.org if you wana get a hold of me.

I have a love of travelling, and chances are, wherever you are, we could find time to meet for soup or coffee sometime in the future!

# You've found Emma Grasmeder's "about me" page

If you want to skip to my [Resume/CV](https://github.com/emmagras/about/blob/master/cv.md) please help yourself, but this page will serve as a good suppliment, and help you piece together the disjoint things you'll find in the resume.

My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emma_gras) is a pretty decent way to get to know what my personality is like. I care about shaping the tech industry to be embracing of diversity. I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to better include, pay, acknowledge, and amplify the voices of people who are (or are a combination of): women, disabled, queer, black or otherwise not white. I also like to be playful and be sarcastic. I've made the decision to be open and honest about being a trans person who struggles sometimes to feel comfortable in, and be kind to, their body.

I think my struggles and regrettable descisions have helped forge me into a stronger, more emotionally intelligent human. I have a habit of learning things the hard way and so I [travel to conferences](https://github.com/emmagras/about/blob/master/speaking-engagements.md) to talk about these lessons, in addition to the technical talks I give.

I have a bachelors degree in religious studies because I was kinda losing my mind during college. The things I studied and continue to study have helped me find meaning and direction in my life, which I feel comfortable and confident in now. I've found several roles that I feel quite genuine and peaceful filling. I feel completely at home when I'm teaching, when I'm digging deep into a mathematical concept, when I'm writing code for hours at a time, and when I'm meeting new people. I learn eagerly and teach constantly. 

I spent three years failing out of a PhD program in economics. I'm proud of this, because I had no economics background whatsoever before my first class in graduate school. Economics is a cool field; I got to study human decision making in a laboratory using human subjects. To collect and analyze the data, I used python, primarily. 

My research position in grad school required me to develop 20 hours a week in python, and learn statistics for another 20 hours a week. (There were several other projects to fill another 30 hours during those weeks!). Now I used Golang and Python to write data driven code and services. I'm also learning Javascript and C++ in my spare time. 

I recently left my job as the chief data scientist of a small startup, left my position as a director with Women Who Code: DC, and moved to Berlin to look for work! I'm a dreamer and a doer, and I'd love to meet you for coffee.

# You've found Emma Grasmeder's "about me" page

If you want to skip to my [Resume/CV](https://github.com/emmagras/about/blob/master/cv.md) please help yourself, but this page will serve as a good suppliment, and help you piece together the disjoint things you'll find in the resume. You can also [raise an issue on this repository](https://github.com/emmagras/about/issues) to ask me any questions about myself. ❤️

My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emma_gras) is a pretty decent way to get to know what my personality is like. I care about shaping the tech industry to be embracing of diversity. I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to better include, pay, acknowledge, and amplify the voices of people who are (or are a combination of): women, disabled, queer, black/otherwise not white, mothers, neuro-atypical. I also like to be playful and be sarcastic. I've made the decision to be open and honest about being a trans person who struggles sometimes to feel comfortable in, and be kind to, their body. <---My pronouns are the "singular they," you'll get used to it.

I think my struggles and regrettable descisions have helped forge me into a stronger, more emotionally intelligent human. I have a habit of learning things the hard way and so I [travel to conferences](https://github.com/emmagras/about/blob/master/speaking-engagements.md) to talk about these lessons in addition to the technical talks I give.

I have a bachelors degree in religious studies because I was kinda losing my mind during college. The things I studied and continue to study have helped me find meaning and direction in my life, which I feel comfortable and confident in now. I've found several roles that I feel quite genuine and peaceful filling. I feel completely at home when I'm teaching, when I'm digging deep into a mathematical concept, when I'm writing code for hours at a time, and when I'm meeting new people. I learn eagerly and teach constantly. 

I spent three years failing out of a PhD program in economics. I'm proud of this, because I had no economics background whatsoever before my first class in graduate school. Economics is a cool field; I got to study human decision making in a laboratory using human subjects. To collect and analyze the data, I used python, primarily. 

My research position in grad school required me to develop software in Python for 20 hours, learn statistics for another 20 hours a week, and work on a lot of other projects in another 30 hours during those weeks! Now I use Golang and Python to write data driven code and services. I'm also learning Javascript and C++ in my spare time. 

I'm just starting a job at [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox) on their DataOps team, which has people in San Fancisco, Washington DC, and Berlin. It's been a dream since forever to live in Europe, and I honestly couldn't be more excited doing it with Mapbox. 

When I left my position at Women Who Code to move to Berlin, I found a wide world of possibilities in front of me. Now I spend a lot of time searching for what I will make and create outside of work. Between all that, I'm sure I could find some time for a coffee with you!

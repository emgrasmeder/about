# You've found Emma Grasmeder's "about me" page

If you want to skip to my [Resume/CV](https://github.com/emmagras/about/blob/master/cv.md) please help yourself, but this page will serve as a good supplement, and help you piece together the disjoint things you'll find in the resume. You can also [raise an issue on this repository](https://github.com/emmagras/about/issues) to ask me any questions about myself. ❤️

My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emilyagras) is a pretty decent way to get to know what my personality is like. You'll quickly notice that I care about shaping the tech industry to be embracing of diversity and that I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to better include, pay, acknowledge, and amplify the voices of people who are (or are a combination of): women, disabled, queer, black/otherwise not white, mothers, neuro-atypical. I also like to be playful and be sarcastic. I've made the decision to be open and honest about being a trans person who struggles sometimes to feel comfortable in, and be kind to, their body. My pronoun is the "[singular they](https://pronoun.is/they)," you'll get used to it.

I think my struggles and regrettable descisions have helped forge me into a stronger, more emotionally intelligent human. I have a habit of learning things the hard way and so I [travel to conferences](https://github.com/emmagras/about/blob/master/speaking-engagements.md) to talk about these lessons in addition to the technical talks I give.

I have a bachelors degree in religious studies because I was kinda losing my mind during college. The things I studied and continue to study have helped me find meaning and direction in my life, which I feel comfortable and confident in now. I've found several roles that I feel quite genuine and peaceful filling. I feel completely at home when I'm teaching, when I'm digging deep into a mathematical concept, when I'm writing code for hours at a time, and when I'm meeting new people. I learn eagerly and teach constantly. 

I spent three years failing out of a PhD program in economics. I'm proud of this, because I had no economics background whatsoever before my first class in graduate school. Economics is a cool field; I got to study human decision making in a laboratory using human subjects. To collect and analyze the data, I used python, primarily. 

My research position in grad school required me to develop software in Python for 20 hours, learn statistics for another 20 hours a week, and work on a lot of other projects in another 30 hours during those weeks! Now I'm comfortable using Golang, Python, Node, or Bash to write test and data driven code and services. 

I've held Data Science positions in a couple startups, most recently at [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox) on their telemetry team. I'm currently looking to focus either more directly in machine learning / statistical programming, or start interfacing with humans more as a developer advocate or teacher. I have a proclivity for communicating technical subjects and finding common ground with people, and an intense love of math.

I have a love of travelling, and chances are, wherever you are, we could find time to meet for soup or coffee sometime in the future!
